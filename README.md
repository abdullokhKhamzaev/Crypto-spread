# 🔒 Crypto Hedged Arbitrage Scanner

**Safe and guaranteed profit** through hedged arbitrage across Binance, MEXC, and Bitget exchanges.

---

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project implements a **hedged arbitrage** trading system that:
- Scans spot and futures prices across 3 exchanges in real-time
- Calculates net spread after all costs (fees, funding rates)
- Displays only profitable opportunities (risk-free)
- Provides a Vue.js dashboard for monitoring and execution

### **What is Hedged Arbitrage?**

Traditional arbitrage: Buy on Exchange A → Transfer → Sell on Exchange B (RISKY - price may change during transfer)

**Hedged arbitrage:** 
1. Buy SPOT on Exchange A at $1.00
2. Open SHORT FUTURES on Exchange B at $1.02 (simultaneously!)
3. Transfer coins (price protected by short position)
4. Close both positions
5. **Guaranteed profit:** $0.02 - fees = ~$0.01 per $1 traded

## 🔐 SECURITY & SAFETY

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Mode: TEST (no real trading)
- ✅ No API keys configured
- ✅ Action buttons disabled for losses
- ✅ Dashboard is read-only

### **Before Live Trading:**
1. Create API keys on exchanges (Read + Trade permissions)
2. Enable Spot + Futures for each API
3. Set IP whitelist for security
4. Add keys to `backend/config.json`
5. Change mode to "live"
6. Start with small amounts ($300-500)

## 📚 DOCUMENTATION FILES

1. **README.md** (this file) - Technical overview
2. **QUICK_START.md** - User guide in Uzbek (5-minute start)
3. **HEDGED_ARB_GUIDE.md** - Detailed trading guide in Uzbek

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### **Current Limitations:**

1. **No execution functionality yet** - Dashboard shows opportunities but cannot execute trades automatically
2. **Manual trading required** - User must manually place orders on exchanges
3. **No position tracking** - No tracking of open positions
4. **No API integration** - API keys configured but not used yet
5. **Volume data is mocked** - Estimated volume is random (not real)

### **Resolved Issues:**

✅ FTM false positive (removed - no futures on Binance)  
✅ Same-exchange spreads filtered out  
✅ Negative spreads hidden from UI  
✅ Filter issues resolved  
✅ Real-time data flowing correctly  

---

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS (TODO)

### **Phase 1: Manual Trading (Current)**
- ✅ Scanner working
- ✅ Dashboard displaying opportunities
- ✅ User reads guide and trades manually

### **Phase 2: Semi-Automated (Next)**
- [ ] Create `backend/executor.js` for order execution
- [ ] Add dry-run mode (simulated orders)
- [ ] Test with API keys in test mode
- [ ] Add position tracker

### **Phase 3: Fully Automated**
- [ ] One-click execution from dashboard
- [ ] Automatic position management
- [ ] Transfer automation (if possible)
- [ ] Telegram notifications
- [ ] Position monitoring dashboard

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Hedged arbitrage is safer than spot arbitrage** but still has risks:
   - API failures
   - Exchange downtime
   - Liquidation risk if leverage > 1x
   - Funding rate costs

2. **Always use 1x leverage** for futures positions

3. **Test with small amounts first** ($300-500)

4. **Monitor positions actively** - don't leave them open for days

5. **Best transfer networks:**
   - BSC (fast, cheap)
   - Polygon (fast, cheap)
   - Avoid native networks (slow, expensive)
